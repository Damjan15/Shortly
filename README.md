# Shortly - More than just shorter links
Shortly is a company that offers link shortening services with advanced statistics and analytics. My role in this project was to create the landing page and integrate the Shortcode API.

## The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen
- Shorten any URL
- Receive an error message if the form is submitted and the input field is empty

## Built with
- React.JS
- TailwindCSS and custom CSS
- Mobile first workflow
